# TS.AUTOFORECAST

Automatically select and fit the best forecasting model for a time series, returning predicted future values.

`TS.AUTOFORECAST` evaluates all enabled auto-forecasting model families and selects the best model based on
cross-validation error. By default, AutoARIMA, AutoETS, and AutoTheta are enabled; AutoTBATS, MFLES, and
MSTL can be enabled via the `MODELS` argument. The command returns the predicted values, model selection
metadata, and optionally prediction intervals and the ability to persist forecasts into a new or existing time series key.

## Syntax

</details>

<details open>
<summary><code>MODELS family1[,family2 ...]</code></summary>

Comma-separated list of model families to evaluate. Supported values (case-insensitive):

| Value   | Aliases     | Default | Description                                                                 |

| `ETS`   | `AUTOETS`   | Yes     | Automatic exponential smoothing                                             |
| `THETA` | `AUTOTHETA` | Yes     | Theta method for forecasting                                                |

| `MSTL`  | —           | No      | Multiple seasonal-trend decomposition with LOESS                            |

If omitted, ARIMA, ETS, and THETA are enabled by default. At least one valid model must be specified.
</details>

<details open>
<summary><code>LEVEL confidence_level</code></summary>

Confidence level for prediction intervals, as a percentage between `0` and `100` (exclusive). For example, `LEVEL 95`
returns 95% prediction intervals.

When specified, the response includes:

- `level` — the confidence level
- `lower_interval` — array of lower bounds for each forecast point
- `upper_interval` — array of upper bounds for each forecast point

For each point `i`, `lower_interval[i] <= forecast[i] <= upper_interval[i]`.
</details>

<details open>
<summary><code>METRICS</code></summary>

When specified, the response includes a `metrics` map computed with
`anofox-forecast`'s `calculate_metrics` using in-sample observed values and
fitted values from the selected model.

Returned fields:

- `mae`
- `mse`
- `rmse`
- `mape` (may be `null` when actual contains zeros)
- `smape`
- `mase` (may be `null` when insufficient scaling history)
- `r_squared`

</details>

<details open>
<summary><code>STORE destination</code></summary>

Persist the forecast values into a time series key. The predicted values are stored as samples with timestamps continuing
from the last observed timestamp using the series' median sampling interval.

- If the destination key does not exist, a new time series is created.
- If the destination key already exists, the forecast samples are merged into it.
- When the source series has fewer than 2 timestamps or no positive time intervals, `STORE` is skipped with a warning.
</details>

## Model Selection

`TS.AUTOFORECAST` evaluates each enabled model family by fitting multiple candidate models and comparing their
cross-validation performance. The model with the lowest error is selected to produce the final forecast.

- **AutoARIMA**: Automatically determines the optimal ARIMA (p,d,q) or SARIMA (P,D,Q,m) parameters.
- **AutoETS**: Automatically selects the best ETS (Error-Trend-Seasonality) model.
- **AutoTheta**: Fits the Theta method, which decomposes the series into short-term and long-term components.
- **AutoTBATS**: Automatically configures TBATS (Trigonometric seasonality, Box-Cox transformation, ARMA errors,
  Trend, and Seasonal components). Designed for data with complex, multiple, or non-integer seasonality.
  Requires `SEASONALITY` to be set.
- **MFLES**: Multiplicative-Fourier Least-squares Ensemble with Shrinkage. Uses Fourier basis functions for
  seasonal decomposition with a learned trend component. Supports robust mode and multiplicative handling.
- **MSTL**: Multiple Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS. Decomposes the series into trend and
  multiple seasonal components, then forecasts each separately. Supports configurable trend and seasonal
  forecasting methods.

The returned model name reflects the concrete model variant:

| Internal Name        | Returned Name |
|----------------------|---------------|
| `AutoARIMA`          | `ARIMA`       |
| `AutoARIMA (SARIMA)` | `SARIMA`      |
| `AutoETS`            | `ETS`         |
| `AutoTheta`          | `Theta`       |
| `AutoTBATS`          | `AutoTBATS`   |
| `MFLES`              | `MFLES`       |
| `MSTL`               | `MSTL`        |

## Examples

### Basic Forecast

```
TS.AUTOFORECAST temperature:sensor1 - + HORIZON 5
```

### With Prediction Intervals

Predict 10 points with 95% confidence intervals:

```

Specify hourly data with daily seasonality (period=24):

```
TS.AUTOFORECAST temperature:sensor1 - + HORIZON 24 SEASONALITY 24 MODELS ARIMA,ETS
```

### Store Forecast to a Key

Predict 5 points and persist them to a destination key:

```
TS.AUTOFORECAST temperature:sensor1 - + HORIZON 5 STORE temperature:sensor1:forecast
```

### Forecast on a Subset of Data

Use only the last 30 days of data:

```
TS.AUTOFORECAST temperature:sensor1 30d + HORIZON 7
```

## Complexity

Depends on the number of enabled model families and the size of the input time series. Each model family performs a
hyperparameter search proportional to the number of candidate models evaluated.

Forecasting is executed on a background thread to avoid blocking the server.
